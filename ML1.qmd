# Dataset Identification and Exploratory Data Analysis





## Dataset Clarification

Our data set consists of an expression profiling by array. We have 763
primary medulloblastoma samples used for identification of Medulloblastoma subtypes, profiled with the Affimetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST Array. The data set was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO GSE85218).

It contributes to the field of genomics given is one the biggest of its type. This is valuable because each subgroup of medulloblastoma  has its medical features, making each subgroup more susceptible to a different treatment.


## Exploratory Data Analysis 



# Justification of Machine Learning


## Justification for Machine Learning

It is known that there are 4 subgroups of medulloblastoma.
We aim to apply Machine Learning in such a way that we are able to classify each of the 4 defined medulloblastoma subtypes. This
cannot be done by a bioinformatic analysis. 


## Project description

I am modeling medulloblastoma subgroups as a function of a set of gene expressions.
