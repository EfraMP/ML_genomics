# Dataset Identification and Exploratory Data Analysi





## Dataset Clarification

Our data set consists of an expression profiling by array. We have 763
primary medullobalstoma samples used for identification of Medullobastoma subtypes, profiled with the Affimetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST Array. The data set was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO GSE85218).

It contributes to the field of genomics given is one the biggest of its type.
